<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Simple EDA App][product_screenshot]][app_launch-url]

This is a simple web application which can perform some of the basic Exploratory Data Analysis on any csv or excel files. Following are the funcionalities of the app:
* Chosse a local file (csv or excel), or choose a predefined file to begin the analysis
* Preview the dataset as per number of rows and columns selected
* Highlight number of missing values in each column
* Display datatypes of each column
* Display number of unique values in a column
* Display summary of numerical columns of the dataset
* Visualise heatmap of correlation matrix
* Display pie plot, bar plot, line plot, box plot, histogram, distribution plot

The EDA is the first operation on a dataset. This app performs some of the general functionalities on a csv file or excel file. Hope it helps to reduce the effort in writing EDA code from scratch. Please do ‚≠ê my repository if it helped you in any way.


### Built With

The app is built with [Streamlit][framework-url] framework in [Python][python-url] language. Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. The app is deployed in [Heroku][heroku-url]. Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
